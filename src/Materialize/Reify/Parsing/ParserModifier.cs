    //ParserVisitor would for each top expression, if it were a call... 




    //It's true: unlike mappers, each call node has no idea of what feeds it: it knows its type perhaps,
    //though this is largely useless by its self. And so it makes little sense for each modiifer to delegate
    //downwards for its source. Modifiers - or rather strategies - could however preempt their other typed 
    //arguments, if these are also to be parsed (far off in the future this). 

    //So contextual flagss are the only way for layers to communicate to each other.
    //But for this, they must be in charge of creating the child context... Or strategies
    //could just expose properties that could be fed back into subsequent contexts by the parser.
