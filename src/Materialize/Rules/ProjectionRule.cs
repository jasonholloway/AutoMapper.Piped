            //as things are with projection, all source properties are brought into the data type, which is fair enough,
            //so we fetch all we need for reconstitution.

            //the expression to be bound with each member is the subreifier's concern. And the type of the expression
            //it offers us should be respected, in that our own custom type must accommodate it. 
            //Reconstition is a further step; offering up the correct eventual types is not important here.

            //With this the case, then any rule that delegates downwards must expect custom types, and must
            //accommodate them. That is, even innocent PropertyMappings need custom data types.

            //To decide on its own behaviour, each ruled node therefore first needs to examine its children,
            //rather than deciding up front, then chugging out child reifiers monolithically. 

            //This is a sub-rule, indeed, selectable only after children have been examined. At which point does
            //such examination become possible? Either with the fetching of a typemap, or the analysis of the
            //needs of a projection expression.

            //Non-EDM-compatible projections need simply need data types populating; only reconstitution actually
            //applies the projection; the expression-mapping behaviour is identical to non-direct property maps.

            //And whether property mapping is direct or indirect via a data type is again decided by delegating
            //to child nodes. First step of consulting children is common.

            //But the decision of whether we need to consult with children is itself rule-determined. As if the very
            //top-level rule objects need to delegate downwards before deciding their own applicability. Yet it is the
            //rule itself that identifies possible children. So does each rule need to delegate downwards just to say
            //yes or no? This is unavoidable. Unless this common information is aggregated beforehand by the too-clever
            //runner. Like rules should be able to request cached information objects from their context. The context
            //would of course be fresh for each stratum.

            //So DirectPropertyMap rule would test for TypeMap object, then would get rules for all children,
            //before deciding on its own applicability. Would these child rules, still of use to IndirectPropertyMap,
            //be jettisoned? Surely not... Could I suppose delegate directly to IndirectPropertyMap here - could in fact
            //just serve different factory. This would seem simplest solution.

            //But how could we get these child rules in their totality? Only in the full analysis (currently taking place 
            //in factory ctor) of each rule's situation can each child decision be made. This decision must then
            //be made up front and returned by the rule itself. Functionality needs to creep back from the factory to
            //the rule itself. Yet, as is, this won't be strongly-typed, as that is the advantage of the factory.






            //Seems then that splitting rules horizontally makes no sense: different rules share too many behaviours.
            //Need behaviours as set of components, built up through analysis of probelm at hand.

            //Components of algo:
            //  > Member values required
            //      - either PropertyMaps or from projection exp.
            //  > Get mapped value expressions from below
