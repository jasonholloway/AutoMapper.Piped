> Strategies should also be keyed by provider type
	- although theres nothing to say these won't be proxied or something. In any case, they could unacceptably vary,
		and defeat our cache.
	- should be keyed on category of provider then, and this is signified by chosen QueryRegime.

> Imagining layers of strategy then. First we choose a QueryRegime, and create a IReifyStrategySource, which will be a 
	proxy of the global source, but with the ReifyContext pre-set with the regime.

> This is a big, lingering to-do: figure out how to nicely build strategies and contexts.
