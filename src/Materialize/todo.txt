	As the query is parsed, then a map of what things are mapped where needs to be constructed, with edges
	marked as transitive or not.

	Subsequent parse strategies can thereafter use the information of the map to rewrite the source query.

	Eventually, the mapping operation itself could be folded into such a structure. As is, it would have 
	to play a large part in the generation of the map, though subsequent Select statements will also contribute.
