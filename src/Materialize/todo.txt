	As the query is parsed, then a map of what things are mapped where needs to be constructed, with edges
	marked as transitive or not.

	Subsequent parse strategies can thereafter use the information of the map to rewrite the source query.

	Eventually, the mapping operation itself could be folded into such a structure. As is, it would have 
	to play a large part in the generation of the map, though subsequent Select statements will also contribute.
	
	
	*********************************************************************************************************************************
	The mapping layer needs to register its RebaseStrategies: each one registered against a memberinfo and an instance TypeVector
	
	
	
	
or maybe each mapstrategy could be asked to rebase the passed subject
as is, rebasestrategizer does half of this itself.

in rebasing however, maybe we could burrow back down the stack, with each layer responsible
for *some* rebasing. this is an established idea of course.

the first layers would deal with the first layers of the rebasing.

eg:  qySource
		.select(i => map(i))		Changes the root, must apply rebase to passed expression. A conglomeration of strategies here, the outermost of which is a CollectionMapStrategy.
										Could we say then that the CollectionMapStrategy has first responsibility for rebasing? What would it do? Rebase the iqueryable root.
										And in processing the where clause in the expression, it would delegate rebasing of the elemental predicate to its own, inner elemental
										MapStrategy. This latter would then receive the predicate to rebase (ie the predicate, plus expected typevector, determined from outside).
										
										The CollectionMapStrategy would then have a special handler for encountered Where clauses in the subject. Or rather, a special predicate
										handler should be registrable on the common visitor. 
										
										The elemental MapStrategy would then receive a predicate, rooted in its own TDest. It would have to visit handle this predicate, and from this point
										on, if it were a PropertyMapStrategy, would find instances of rooted members it had projected to, and replace these with original accessors. It would
										delegate to its child MapStrategies to map successive accessors, somehow. Well, as part of coping with the reversion to the original accessor, 
										
										PropertyMapStrategy would of course encounter vectorised roots. And at that time, if all were standard, the entire root would be projected,
										property-by-property, ready to be tested as its destination type. Obviously though, this would be hideous. Single properties should be
										picked up. PropertyMapStrategy, as special behaviour, should then find relevant and rooted property accesses. Child strategies should though
										be given a chance to kick in... Succeeding member accesses should be handled by the inner MapStrategy. Seems that inner Strategies should
										be implicated by each link of the accessor chain. PropertyMapStrategy finds its own root, and finds its own relevant accessors, for which
										it generates its own RebaseStrategies. This then is available in the handling of the succeeding accessor. 
										
										Or each nested MapStrategy could publish its own map of rebasing handlers, against TypeVector and MemberInfo. But such rules should be
										scoped. They are only applicable in the part of the mapping the nested strategy pertains to. In confronting a successive accessor, the
										problem is solved upstream, but shifted downwards. At the same time, the PropertyMapStrategy knows, through the implication of one of
										its propertymaps, that the solutions of the nested strategy are now pertinent, but limited to only this case. From the root onwards,
										its own special strategies have been in force. From the handling of the first accessor on the root, the child's strategies should be in
										force too. 
										
										So instead of delegating downwards, nested strategies would publish upwards. These strategies would be published by other published
										strategies, such that one handler would spread further handlers to take any succeeding, dependent expressions, until the end of the
										root chain (whether a node is rooted becomes the decision of the upwardly-published RebaseStrategy).
										
										Basically, IRebaseStrategy would be expanded to also offer up further strategies. Which would affect the functioning of the visitor, of course.
										Would this increased offering be keyed by member-accessor and typevector? There is again the issue of parameter roots being found. These are,
										internally to the visitor, compared to a contextual dictionary. Our approach with accessors seems similar. Yet the parameter that would offer
										up our new scope of property strategies must also be handled by an intruding strategy - can't just emplace from the visitor itself, as however
										would our new map of property-handlers be made available? PropertyMapStrategy must give us the RebaseStrategy for our encountered root: this is
										its access into the cascading behaviour of the visitor.
										
										The outer Visit method gives a chance to hook the visitor's behaviour. If a bank of handlers were in place to test every visited node... and usually
										very few such hooks would be in place, except the omnipresent root detectors. Such root detectors would have to compare to the new root param somehow.
										
										Also, what would emplace the root hook? Whatever generated the new root param. That is, the orchestrator of this pass of the RebaseStrategizer.
										
										
										*******************************************************
										
										Each encountered root would return an IRebaseStrategy offered by the in-force IMapStrategy. This IRebaseStrategy would then be delegated to
										on return to each enclosing element handler. This IRebaseStrategy would decide whether it were a root, obvs. If it were a root (and it always 
										would be!), then the enclosing handler would again delegate to it. The root IRebaseStrategy would then have a chance to return a new 
										IRebaseStrategy, which may or may not be itself rooted. Rootedness really refers to this capability of handling successive clauses.
										A rooted IRebaseStrategy is expansionist; a normal one keeps to itself.
										
										The RebaseStrategizer then crawls and supplies simple rebase strategies for most of the subject tree. But in the case of a root, it delegates
										to a supplied root handler, which emplaces its own expansionist strategy.

										*** Expansionist IRebaseStrategy ***
										
										A strategy is selected by the form of the initial expression, and then executed against each particular incoming instance of that form.
										
										In the case of root rebase strategies, the encountered parameter is in each case the particular input to satisfy the strategy shaped to
										expect such singular input.
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
										
		.take(10)
		.where(m => pred(m))		Initiates rebase on Where clause *similar* to itself (but not on itself!). But the subject clause will be rooted the same.
